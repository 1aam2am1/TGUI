    <h1>TGUI</h1>
    
    <p>The TGUI website is down.</p>
    
    <p>You can still download TGUI from <a href="https://github.com/texus/TGUI">https://github.com/texus/TGUI</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The documentation can still be accessed on <a href="http://tgui.eu/dcmtn/v0.5/">http://tgui.eu/dcmtn/v0.5/</a> and <a href="http://tgui.eu/dcmtn/v0.6/">http://tgui.eu/dcmtn/v0.6/</a>.<br />
       The tutorials and the forum are however no longer available (for now).</p>
    
    <p>
    If you need to get in contact with me, you can send me a PM on the sfml forum (username texus) or send an email to <a href="mailto:bruno.vandevelde@student.uantwerpen.be">bruno.vandevelde@student.uantwerpen.be</a>.<br />
    Sending a mail to an address ending in "tgui.eu" or "tgui.net" will NOT reach me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I will try to fix this issue as soon as possible.<br />
    Thank you for your understanding.
