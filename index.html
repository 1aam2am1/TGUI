    <h1>TGUI</h1>

    <p><span style="color: #ff3333">THE REAL WEBSITE IS DOWN. THIS IS A TEMPORARY BACKUP SITE.</span><br />
       The website will be back online in January. In february I will attempt to move my site to a more reliable host (Github Pages probably).
    </p>

    <p>TGUI is an easy to use cross-platform GUI based on SFML2 and written in C++.<br />
       The .Net version (tested with C# and VB.Net) can be found on <a href="http://tgui.net">tgui.net</a></p>

    <p>
    Features:
    <ul>
        <li>Extremely easy to use: only a few lines of code and you have a fully working edit box.</li>
        <li>Cross-platform: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.</li>
        <li>Create unlimited objects, even while the program is running e.g. create object on click.</li>
        <li>Objects can be loaded from a file, you can update e.g. the positions without recompilation.</li>
        <li>TGUI uses an internal texture manager so that no image is loaded twice.</li>
        <li>TGUI used the camelCase notation which is the same as SFML uses.</li>
        <li>Just like SFML, it is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.</li>
        <li>TGUI provides an easy to use drag-and-drop form builder.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
