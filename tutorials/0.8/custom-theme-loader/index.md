This tutorial is not written yet and is not likely to be added soon because this part of the code has not been tested very well.

To creating a custom theme loader you basically just have to inherit from the BaseThemeLoader class and pass an instance to the static Theme::setThemeLoader function.

Feel free to experiment with it and let me know about things that could be improved in the BaseThemeLoader or Theme class to make things easier.
