  <h2>iOS (experimental)</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Please note that support for iOS is still in an early stage, you will have to do a lot of things manually. This guide is meant to get you started, it is not complete.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>You must have already build SFML for iOS and verified that you can run your sfml app on your device or emulator. Only then should you proceed with installing TGUI.</p>

    <p>You will need to use CMake in order to build TGUI. You can download the latest version <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">here</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>CMake</h3>
    <p>Start by filling in the location of the source code (the TGUI folder that you downloaded) and a build directory (usually a new directory that you create inside the TGUI folder). But don't click the Configure button yet.</p>
    <p class="SmallBottomMargin">In order to build for iOS instead of for OS X, you must create a new entry named IOS and set it to TRUE. You do this by clicking the "Add entry" button.</p>
    <a class="img" href="{{site.url}}/resources/CMakeSetIOS.png"><img alt="Add IOS entry" src="{{site.url}}/resources/CMakeSetIOS.png" width="796" height="410" /></a>

    <p class="SmallBottomMargin">After that, you can press Configure. You will be asked to select a generator. You should select "Xcode" here.</p>

    <p>From now on there will be no more screenshots to guide you, so read everything carefully.</p>
    <p>In order to make CMake find SFML and its dependencies, you must set the SFML_ROOT entry to the location of your SFML folder, which contains the extlibs/libs-ios folder and provides a lib folder which directly contains the static sfml libraries (so no Debug/Release subfolder).</p>
    <p>CMake tends to look for frameworks first. Even though it might configure fine, check to make sure that the FREETYPE_LIBRARY and the JPEG_LIBRARY are set to the .a files from the SFML_ROOT/extlibs/libs-ios folder. If they contain other values then change these entries manually.</p>
    <p>You should now be able to click Configure and Generate without problems.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Building the library</h3>
    <p>CMake will have generated an Xcode project. Go into your build folder and open it. You should just be able to build it without problems.</p>
    <p>If all goes well, your build folder will contain a lib folder with the static tgui library in it (inside the Debug or Release subfolder).</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Using TGUI</h3>
    <p>You are completely on your own now. I haven't went this far myself yet. But you should be able to add TGUI to your project in the same way as you added SFML.</p>
