  <h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
  <p>You must have already build SFML for iOS and verified that you can run your sfml app on your device or emulator. Only then should you proceed with installing TGUI.</p>

  <p>You will need to use CMake in order to build TGUI. You can download the latest version <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="cmake">CMake</h3>
  <p>Start by filling in the location of the source code (the TGUI folder that you downloaded) and a build directory (usually a new directory that you create inside the TGUI folder). But don't click the Configure button yet.</p>
  <p class="SmallBottomMargin">In order to build for iOS instead of for OS X, you must create a new entry named IOS and set it to TRUE. You do this by clicking the "Add Entry" button.</p>
  <a class="img" href="/resources/CMakeSetIOS.png"><img alt="Add IOS entry" src="/resources/CMakeSetIOS.png" width="796" height="410" /></a>

  <p class="SmallBottomMargin">After that, you can press Configure. You will be asked to select a generator. You should select "Xcode" here.</p>

  <p>There are no more screenshots for the next part, so read everything extra careful.</p>
  <p>In order to make CMake find SFML and its dependencies, you may have to set the SFML_ROOT entry to the location of your SFML folder, which contains the extlibs/libs-ios folder and provides a lib folder which directly contains the static sfml libraries (so no Debug/Release subfolder).</p>
  <p>CMake seems to look for frameworks first. Even though it might configure fine, check to make sure that the FREETYPE_LIBRARY and the JPEG_LIBRARY are set to the .a files from the SFML_ROOT/extlibs/libs-ios folder. If they contain other values then change these entries manually.</p>
  <p>You should now be able to click Configure and Generate without problems.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="building_the_library">Building the library</h3>
  <p class="SmallBottomMargin">CMake will have generated an Xcode project. Go into your build folder, open the project and build it.</p>
  <a class="img" href="/resources/iOS-0.7/XCodeBuild.jpg"><img alt="XCode Build library" src="/resources/iOS-0.7/XCodeBuild.jpg" width="334" height="99" /></a>
  <p>If all goes well, your build folder will contain a lib folder with the static tgui library in it (inside the Debug or Release subfolder).</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="using_tgui">Using TGUI</h3>
  <p class="SmallBottomMargin">Just drag the tgui-s.a (or tgui-s-d.a) file into your project.</p>

  <p class="SmallBottomMargin">A screen like below will appear asking you what to do. Make sure that "Copy items if needed", "Create folder references" and your target are all checked.</p>
