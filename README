TGUI - Texus's Graphical User Interface
=======================================

In one line: TGUI is an easy to use, cross-platform, c++ GUI for SFML.
For more information, take a look at the website (http://tgui.weebly.com).



Download & Install
------------------

You can download the latest release on Github (https://github.com/texus/TGUI).

You will need to build TGUI with CMake before you can use it or you can use the source code directly in your project.
Using CMake is pretty easy and you can find tutorials on my site (http://tgui.weebly.com/tutorials.html).



Tutorials
---------

Except for the installation tutorials there are no tutorials yet.
You can however easily learn TGUI by the richly commented example code (http://tgui.weebly.com/example-code.html)
