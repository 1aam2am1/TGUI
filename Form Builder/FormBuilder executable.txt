TGUI no longer comes with an executable for the Form Builder, it will be build together with the TGUI libraries if you leave the TGUI_BUILD_FORM_BUILDER option checked in CMake.
If all goes well then the executable will be copied to this folder (with the necessary dll files on windows).

This has been tested and is working on linux and on Windows in CodeBlocks.

This procedure however fails on Windows when using Visual Studio. The executable will not be copied to this folder.
You will find it in a folder like build/src/TGUI/Release, depending on your configuration (Debug/Release or another name for your build folder).
If you were linking dynamically (TGUI_SHARED_LIBS checked in CMake) then you must also copy the tgui(-d).dll and the dlls from sfml (main, system, window and graphics) to this folder.
