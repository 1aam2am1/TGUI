<p class="SmallBottomMargin">The first released version (v0.3.0)</p>
<a class="img" href="/resources/Screenshot_v0.3.0.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot v0.3.0" src="/resources/Screenshot_v0.3.0.jpg" width="480" height="360" /></a>

<p class="SmallBottomMargin">
    Of course the background color of the listbox didn’t fit with the Black style.<br />
    By the time v0.3.4 was released, this was solved and a scrollbar and combo box were added.

<p class="SmallBottomMargin">TGUI v0.4 also adds a Label and TextBox to this. Other new objects like the Panel and SpriteSheet objects are however not in the screenshots. Also the blue color was changed to look better.</p>

<p class="SmallBottomMargin">TGUI v0.4 also comes with the new BabyBlue style (which is copied from <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/635698-UI-Kit-Baby-Blue">Michael Donovan’s UI Kit</a>)</p>

<p class="SmallBottomMargin">
    With TGUI v0.4 came the Form Builder, so you could easily arrange your objects.<br />
    I was recording while making this login screen, so you can find it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am_RumRUzZQ">youtube</a>.

<p class="SmallBottomMargin">For v0.6 I rewrote a lot of stuff so I needed to test all objects again. For this I wrote a program that used all objects.</p>
