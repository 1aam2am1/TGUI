  <h3>Collected data</h3>
  <p>In order to estimate the amount of visitors and downloads, and to check the incoming and outgoing links, analytics may be used to track your activity on this site. The collected data may be shared with third parties and a summary may even be published publically.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
  <h3>Opt-out</h3>
  <p>I do not provide a simple opt-out because I recommend disabling trackers everywhere instead of just on my site. Making your browser send the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track header</a> is already a good start.

  <p class="SmallBottomMargin">I also highly recommend you to install <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/">Firefox</a> and have a look at the following add-ons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/">Ghostery</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">NoScript</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blend-in/">Blend In</a></li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For other browsers you should be able to find similar add-ons to disable trackers.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
  <h3>Policy changes</h3>
  <p>This privacy policy can change at any time without a warning.<br/>
     However, because the site is open-source and hosted on Github Pages, you can follow all changes on <a href="https://github.com/texus/TGUI/commits/gh-pages">github</a>.
